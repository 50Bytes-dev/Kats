Kats: toolKit to Analyze Time Series

Time series analysis is an essential component of data science work at Facebook, from basic explanatory analysis to forecasting the
top-line metrics. There are various open source packages or modules in R/Python/Matlab to perform specific tasks in time series
analysis, while a unified toolbox, especially for Facebookâ€™s use cases, is missed but desired.

The high level goal is to create an easy-to-use, powerful, and generalizable toolbox for time series analysis.

Easy-to-use: simplify most tasks to one-liners with keeping advanced options
Powerful: cover most common functionalities in time series analysis community
Generalizable: capable to extend and combine with most forecasting frameworks including
               statsmodels, Prophet, and many others
